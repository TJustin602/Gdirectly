Testing Your Code
Please provide a list of what test cases you would want to cover for your code. You do not need to write the tests themselves.


Here is a list of some ‘quick’ testing that I considered (did) and could consider more broadly. Overall, the test cases would look to cover ‘the basic’ functionality, the output of expected (correctness), a small performance test based on data sizes, and input validation.

Basic Functionality Tests
I’d want the function to run without errors (I certainly received tons of error with my current coding experience😊 ) and have it run successfully with a “valid” target distribution and recipient list. Successfully would be comparing output to my hypothesis of an output. 

•	Confirm a valid Target Distribution Test

Test with different (valid) target distributions to verify that the function correctly assigns payment configurations based on specified amounts/weights.

•	Recipient List Test
Test with different sizes of recipient lists to confirm the function can handle various input sizes.

•	Weight Sum Validation Test
Test with an invalid target ‘distribution’ where the weights do not sum to 1.0 and that the function shows a ValueError in this case.

•	Dependability Test
Run the function multiple times with the same inputs and check if the distribution of assigned payment configurations is consistent with the distribution.

•	Performance Test
Test the function with a large number of recipients and complex target distribution to assess its performance and then test with a small number of recipients and a simple target distribution to ensure correctness. I feel this one is of importance where it comes to the ‘entire tribe’ instead of just selected recipients in a village. 

•	Input Type Test
Test with different data types (letters,numbers,characters,etc) for the target distribution and recipient list to ensure the function handles them appropriately.

Additional Considerations / Remaining Work

Lastly, if you had more time, what are other issues or scenarios you'd want to spend more time
ensuring your code can address?

I’d want to add an ‘entry screen’ / UI so that the different scenarios could be run rather quickly. I’d also ask ( the persons asking for the above function) if they wanted to keep track of the difference scenarios , based on additional experimentation models, and then plot / graph results to iterate on additional scenarios.
